# User ID Mapping

:::tip
If you have not stored your user's Auth0 userId in your database you can **ignore** this section.
:::

If you store your user's Auth0 `userId` in your tables you will need to map the user's Auth0 `userId` to their SuperTokens `userId` using the UserId Mapping feature. This will ensure that SuperTokens will internally resolve the mapping and the correct `userId` is used.
Once UserId mapping is enabled for a user, passing either the Auth0 `userId` or SuperTokens `userId` will correctly work for SuperTokens functions and the Auth0 `userId` will be returned in the response.
