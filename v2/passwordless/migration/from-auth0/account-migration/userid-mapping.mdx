# User ID Mapping

:::tip
If you have not stored your user's Auth0 userId in your database you can **ignore** this section.
:::

If you store your user's Auth0 `userId` in your tables you will need to map the user's Auth0 `userId` to their SuperTokens `userId`. This can be done by using the UserId mapping feature. It has the following functions:
- `createUserIdMapping`
- `getUserIdMapping`
- `deleteUserIdMapping`
- `updateOrDeleteUserIdMappingInfo`

Once a user's Auth0 `userId` is mapped to their SuperTokens `userId` using the `createUserIdMapping` function, all recipe functions which take a `userId` will internally resolve the mapping and make sure that the correct one is used.

For example, if you have followed the steps mentioned in the [Modifications to Login](./modifications-to-login) section, when a user signs in with their Auth0 account credentials, they will be able to login without having to create a new account. Additionally their `userIds` will be mapped. This means that recipe functions can now take the Auth0 `userId` and will also return the Auth0 `userId` in the response. Functions like `updateUser` can now take the Auth0 `userId` as input and functions like `getUserByEmail` and `getUserById` will return the Auth0 `userId` in their response if the mapping exists.

:::important Note
You cannot map multiple SuperTokens `userIds` to the same `externalUserId`. This use case would be better served by the `Account Linking` feature which is currently in development. You could achieve this flow by adding a postfix to the `externalUserId` when creating the mappings for subsequent SuperTokens `userIds`. You would also have to override all recipe functions that return a `userId` to strip away the known postfix string from the `userIds`before returning them.
