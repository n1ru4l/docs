# About

In this guide we will go through the process of migrating your users from another provider to SuperTokens. The steps in this guide will be generic and should be applicable to most external auth providers. 

To get started, you will first need to setup SuperTokens on your frontend and backend. You can do so by following the [quick setup](/docs/emailpassword/quick-setup/frontend)

There are two steps for migrating users:

1. Account Migration
2. Session Migration


## Step 1) Account Migration

- We will be overriding the SuperTokens login function so that if a user logs into your app with account credentials registered in another provider, their user data will be retrieved from said provider and a new SuperTokens account will be created.
- This results in the user being able to directly login to your app with their existing account credentials without having to sign up again.
- If you have stored a user's pre-existing `userId` in your database, you will need to map the user's pre-existing `userId` to their SuperTokens `userId` during login using SuperTokens' UserId Mapping feature.

You can learn more about how to implement these changes in the [Account Migration](./account-migration/modifications-to-login) section.

## Step 2) Session Migration
- If you have users with an existing session you can use the following guide to migrate them to a SuperTokens session.
- This will result in their current session being revoked and a new SuperTokens session being created.

You can learn more about how to implement these changes in the [Session Migration](./session-migration) section.
